        <p class="essay">Mission Statement</p>
        <p>I want to become financially self-reliant by utilizing my ambition, and to help others after I am set.</p>

        <p class="essay">My American Dream</p>
        <p>I want to achieve financial independence, so I can live a worry-free life while being able to help others be happy.</p>

        <p class="essay">Where My American Dream Values and Goals Appeared in AMST250: American Dream</p>
        <p>My American dream is not fully unique to me or to my time period. An American dream that has a similar theme to mine happened during the time on the first American farms. My dream doesn’t involve me having to rely on others, but I would like to have all of my needs met by my own hard work. The farmers were the first Americans who were able to be self-reliant. The farmers were able to live without worrying about the place their next meal would be coming from. They knew their most basic needs were already being met. In his essay titled “self-reliance”, Emerson states “I hope in these days we have heard the last of conformity and consistency. . . . Let us never bow and apologize more. A great man is coming to eat at my house. I do not wish to please him; I wish that he should wish to please me.” Here he is advocating for knowing your personal worth. In order to be self-reliant, you have to know your own worth and value. A farmer must know that he is worthy to make it on his own, and he does not need anyone else’s help. Just like the farmers, my American dream does not have me relying on others. I do not want someone to be able to use something they do for me as leverage for control over me, like the kings and rulers would do before the farmers came to America to get what they wanted. In Wilder’s book “farmer boy”, the author states “A farmer depends on himself, and the land and the weather. If you're a farmer, you raise what you eat, you raise what you wear, and you keep warm with wood out of your own timber. You work hard, but you work as you please, and no man can tell you to go or come. You'll be free and independent, son, on a farm.” Here the author is echoing what I said just before, that being self-reliant and independent allows you to do as you please and not have to worry about pleasing others. Being self-reliant allows you to help others more easily. This can be seen back with the farmers, as an abundance of grown food allows farmers to share the food they have grown, which then allows other people to branch into other things that aren’t farming. I would like to help others in a similar way if I get to a place where I am self-reliant.
        The American Dream that resonates with me the most is the dream of the Suburbs. Having my own home that I have full ownership of, is a big goal of mine, just as it was the goal of many. A quote that stood out to me was found in Cullen, Chapter 5. It says, “No American Dream has broader appeal, and no American Dream has been quite so widely realized. Roughly two thirds of Americans owned their homes at the start of this century, and it seems reasonable to believe that many of the remaining third will go on to do so”. Being able to own a home was a very popular goal back in the beginnings of the suburbs. Sadly the suburbs were treated as white-only, so non-white people were not able to have the dream of owning a house like the white people could. The last dream that I resonate with is the dream of “wealth”. This dream meshes well with the other dream, as wealth and self-reliance can go hand in hand. When thinking of someone who is wealthy, someone might think about the Kardashians, but that is not the wealth I want. People like the Kardashians are so wealthy that they seemingly can do anything and have no responsibilities. I do not want to have an obscene amount of wealth, but I would like to be wealthy enough to be able to know that my kids will not have to struggle. I hope my ambitions can take me to the point where I am not living paycheck to paycheck, and instead I am able to set my family up with self-reliant wealth for the future.

        <p class="essay">Servant Leadership</p>
        <p>My mission statement reflects the Franciscan call to develop servant leaders. An important part of my mission is to be a working and helpful member of the community. I hope that one day I will have the means to have all of my needs taken care of and I hope to become a beacon of support for anyone to come to when they need help. My mission statement demonstrates the Franciscan call to servant leadership well, because part of my mission is to help others achieve their goals. I will also be passing on these values to the next generation, so they are always willing to help each other. I want to be able to bring the best out in people in any way I can.
